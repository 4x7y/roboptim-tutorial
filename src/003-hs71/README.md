003-hs71
========

The goal is to implement and solve a small optimization problem.

This problem is the 71th problem of the Hock-Schittkowski-Collection
and is defined as:

![Optimization Problem](doc/min.png)

...under the following constraints:

![Optimization Problem](doc/constraints.png)

Step 1: Implement the cost function
-----------------------------------

Implement the cost function `F` by defining a function the same way than
in exercise 1.

The main difference is that now you have to implement a
`DifferentiableFunction` and not a `Function` which means you also
have to provide a way to compute the gradient.


Step 2: Implement the constraints
---------------------------------

Similarly, implement the constraints `G0` and `G1` corresponing to the
first two constraints.

The third constraint only put bounds on the optimization variables and
will be handled during problem instantiation.


Step 3: Create the problem
--------------------------

Instantiate the problem. Add the two necessary constraints. Display
the problem to check that everything is working fine.


Step 4: Solve it
----------------

Instiate a solver factory, a solver and solve the problem. Display the
solver object after solving the problem.


Executing the command `./003-hs71` should give you the following
